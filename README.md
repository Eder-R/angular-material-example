# AngularMaterialExample

This is a sample project, integrated with a backend application to load a list of countries.

## Running the application in dev mode

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Backend

This project is integrated with [quarkus-panache-example](https://github.com/claudiolmc/quarkus-panache-example). The backend application must be running for the frontend application to work properly.
